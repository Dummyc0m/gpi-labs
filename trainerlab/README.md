Welcome to TrainerLab!

First, clone the [repo](https://github.com/cmugpi/gpi-labs) we use to
distribute the labs. There are instructions on that page that should help you
get started.

After you clone the repo, ask the professor what to do!

Note: if it's not clear, the "professor" is a program included in this lab!
Try running it and see what happens. Remember: you can look up how to run
programs on the course website!

When you're done, run the command 'git add gates-hillman-center' and then
'git commit -m "Finish trainerlab"' to save your changes. Next, run the
command 'make', which will give you a handin.zip file.
You can scp it to your laptop and upload it to Autolab
from there.
